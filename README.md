## Why this collection?

I used DaisyUI in some projects and the amount of functionality it offers without any JavaScript code is incredible, not to mention the different themes and
colors available

I didn't find more complex usage examples for DaisyUI anywhere, so I decided to create this collection. I hope it inspires you in your projects!
